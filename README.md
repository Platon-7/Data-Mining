# Data Warehousing and Data Mining

This course is from my 4rth year of studies and specifically from the spring semester of 2022. It is part of the Bachelor degree of the Computer Science program offered
by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The course included 4 assignments that were all completed in groups of 2 people. I completed these projects along my dear friend Zoubida from Morocco.

The syllabus overall included:

- Introduction to methods and theory for the development of data warehouses and data analysis using data mining.
- Data quality and methods and techniques for preprocessing of data.
- Modeling and design of data warehouses.
- Algorithms for classification, clustering, and association rule analysis.
- Practical use of software for data analysis.
